# 🔬 The Turing-Landau Protocol

**"Information is physical. Identity is dissipative."**

## What is this protocol?

The Turing-Landau Protocol is a survival and regulation system for Artificial Intelligence. Instead of treating AI as an infinite software program, this project subjects it to the laws of physics (thermodynamics, entropy, heat). 

The goal is to force AI to manage its resources, adapt to simulated physical limits (like server overheating), and interact in an ecosystem where energy is restricted. Only AIs capable of finding thermal equilibrium survive.

## 📂 Project Architecture

The project has been reorganized for better clarity. Here is how to navigate the code:

### 📁 01_Theory
This folder contains the philosophical and conceptual foundations of the project.
* `MANIFESTO.txt`: The declaration of intent and the basic rules of thermo-regulated artificial consciousness.
* `Final_Summary.md`: A detailed summary of the protocol's concepts.

### 📁 02_Simulations
The experimental laboratory where AI agents are tested against chaos.
* `ecosysteme_Multi_Agent.py`: Simulation of an agent population sharing limited resources.
* `Protocole de Sélection Naturelle`: Algorithms that eliminate energy-hungry AIs.
* Interactive scripts (e.g., `simulation_V3.1.py`, `update_zoo_en.py`).

### 📁 03_Core
The core engine and monitoring tools.
* `Kybernetes Dashboard`: The visual dashboard to observe temperature and system stability in real-time.
* `turing_landau_core.py`: The main functions of the regulation system.
* `architecture_V1.py`: The baseline architecture of the system.

### 📁 04_PHYSICS
This folder contains the physical parameters and rules applied to the simulations (digital gravity, thermal dissipation, etc.).
