# Density-Regulated Quantum Gravity

## Concept Overview
This hypothesis proposes that gravity is not a fundamental force but an emergent, density-regulated field. In this model, spacetime curvature is a direct response to matter density.

## The Experiment (Interference Test)
A proposed experiment to test if gravity behaves according to quantum mechanics principles involves:
1.  **Superposition:** A mass is sent through a beam splitter, traveling two paths (A and B) simultaneously.
2.  **Spacetime Response:** If gravity is quantum, spacetime itself should enter a superposition, curving around both path A and path B.
3.  **Entanglement:** A second mass is introduced to interact with these "split" curvatures.
4.  **Measurement:** The interference pattern at the end determines if spacetime curvature behaved in a quantum way.

## Key Implication
**"No Matter, No Gravity"**
If gravity is strictly density-regulated, it implies that in the absence of matter density, gravity does not exist as an independent field. It requires mass to "activate" the curvature of spacetime.
